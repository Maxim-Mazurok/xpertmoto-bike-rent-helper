## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Internet connection (for fetching live data from Xpert Moto APIs)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xpertmoto-bike-rent-helper.git
   cd xpertmoto-bike-rent-helper
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Add product data**
   
   Place your `example.json` file (containing Shopify product data) in the `public/` folder. This file should contain the product catalog with metafields for pricing and variant information.

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

5. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 📁 Project Structure

```

## 🎯 How It Works

**100% Frontend - No Backend Required!**

1. **Data Fetching** (`src/utils/dataFetcher.js`)
   - Fetches product images from Shopify's `products.json` endpoint
   - Loads `example.json` from the public folder
   - Extracts pricing tiers and variant metadata
   - Queries Izyrent API for real-time booking data (CORS-enabled)
   - Aggregates everything in the browser

2. **Frontend** (`src/`)
   - React + Vite for fast development
   - Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
   - Dynamic pricing calculation based on selected duration
   - Sortable table with sticky columns

## 🔧 Configuration

### Pricing Structure

The dashboard automatically handles Xpert Moto's tiered pricing:
- **Daily rates** (1-6 days): Total price for the period
- **Weekly rates** (7+ days): Per-week pricing with bulk discounts

Example for YAMAHA NMAX155:
- 1 day: $110
- 7 days: $160/week = $160 total
- 14 days: $148/week × 2 = $296 total

## 🌐 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

This project is optimized for Vercel's static deployment:

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import the repository in Vercel
3. Vercel will auto-detect the Vite configuration
4. Ensure `public/example.json` is committed (or add as environment file)
5. Deploy!

**No serverless functions needed** - everything runs in the browser!

### Alternative: Any Static Host

```bash
npm run build
# Deploy the `dist/` folder to:
# - Netlify
# - GitHub Pages
# - Cloudflare Pages
# - Any static hosting service
```

## 📊 API Endpoints Used

### External APIs (called from browser)

- `GET https://xpertmoto.com.au/products.json?limit=250` - Product images
- `POST https://izyrent.speaz.com/front/get_bookings` - Real-time bookings

Both APIs support CORS (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`), so no proxy needed!
